# twitch-data

* Grab data from the Twitch API so that I can display latest follower
and follow count
* Written using node, hopefully using some async-await coolness
* Runs in a docker container so that I don't pollute my env
* Outputs to a text file, so that OBS can grab it and display it
* Don't hit Twitch API rate limits
